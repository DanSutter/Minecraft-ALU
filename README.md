# Minecraft ALU
This was an extra credit project for CS4341 - Digital Logic and Computer Design. The team project was to design and simulate a simple ALU in Verilog (not included). After the project, I created our ALU using Minecraft's redstone. It can perform addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and multiplication on one or two 8-bit binary numbers.  

Tested in version 1.15.2. Should work in any higher versions that do not update redstone mechanics.


## Setup

### Installation
- Purchase Minecraft from Minecraft.net
- Install the Launcher
- Navigate to C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves
- Paste the "CS4341 DigLog ALU" folder

### Launching
- Open Minecraft launcher
- Select version 1.15.2
- Play
- Launch the CS4341 DigLog ALU map

##Operation

There are 3 control areas of note - the operations wall and the two walls for two 8-bit numbers. Flip the levers to switch bits. Lit is 1 and off is 0. Numbers are read left to right when facing the correct side of the wall.  

There are 3 answer areas of note. One for addition/subtraction, one for logic operations, and one for multiplication. Each one is labeled on the correct side of the wall that you should be facing to read the result. Multiplication's result wall is the furthest away from the controls.  

Across from the controls is also examples of the logic gates built from redstone that were used.
